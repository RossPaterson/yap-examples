{- $egfs
This representation corresponds to viewing
a power series \( \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n {x^n \over n!} \)
as the exponential generating function of a sequence \( \{a_n\} \).
The corresponding sequence may be extracted using 'derivatives'.

* /Bernoulli numbers/ (<https://oeis.org/A027641 OEIS A027641> /
<https://oeis.org/A027642 OEIS A027642>) have the exponential
generating function \(x \over e^x - 1\):

[1 % 1,(-1) % 2,1 % 6,0 % 1,(-1) % 30,0 % 1,1 % 42,0 % 1,(-1) % 30,0 % 1,...

* The alternative convention, differing only in the sign of \(B_1\),
has the exponential
generating function \(x + {x \over e^x - 1} = {x e^x \over e^x - 1}\):

We can use 'div' here, because it divides evenly when the numerator has
at least as many leading non-zero terms as the denominator.

-- Number sequences

{- $binomial_transform

Multiplying the exponential generating function of a sequence \( \{a_n\} \)
by \(e^x\) yields the exponential generating function of the sequence

\[
    b_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a_k
\]

The same transformation on sequences from ordinary generating functions
is performed by `Data.YAP.PowerSeries.binomialTransform`.

The inverse transformation, namely

\[
    a_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^{n-k} \binom{n}{k} b_k
\]

is obtained by multiplying by \(e^{ -x}\).
