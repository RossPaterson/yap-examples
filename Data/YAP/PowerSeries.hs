{- | The Riordan array generated by series \(f\) and \(g\), with \(g(0) = 0\),
is a polynomial sequence with ordinary generating function

\[
    {f(t) \over 1 - x g(t)} =
        f(t) \left( 1 + x g(t) + (x g(t))^2 + \cdots \right)
\]

which can be constructed as
@`constants` f * `compose` `monomials` (`constants` g)@.

Setting \(x = 1\) yields \( {f(t) \over 1 - g(t)} \), the ordinary
generating function of the sequence of sums of the coefficients of
the rows.

Since \(g(t)\) is required have a constant term of zero, and thus
has the form \(g(t) = x h(t)\), some authors use the equivalent definition

\[
    {f(t) \over 1 - x t h(t)} =
        f(t) \left( 1 + x t h(t) + (x t h(t))^2 + \cdots \right)

{- $pgf
A power series whose coefficients sum to 1 may encode the probabilites of
each possible value of a natural number-valued random variable \(X\),
i.e. \( p_k = \Pr(X = k) \).
Such a series is then the probability generating function \(E[z^X]\).

* `one` is the PGF for the constant random variable with value 0.

* `identity` is the PGF for the constant random variable with value 1.

* If @pX@ is the PGF for the random variable \(X\), then the PGF for
  \(c X\) for natural number \(c\) is @pX .^ c@.

* The product of PGFs for independent random variables \(X\) and \(Y\)
  is the PGF for \(X+Y\).

* The sum of the coefficients of the derivative of a PGF is the expected
  value of the random variable.
